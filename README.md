# next-level-recursion
Source code for the Dev.to article on recursion after factorials and Fibonacci

## Source Code

The following files demonstrate three different recursive functions, two simple and one more complicated. The simple examples are accompanied by there iterative counterparts.

### Simple (textbook) examples
* Factorial - recursive
* Factorial - inerative (using a for loop)
* Fibonacci - recursive
* Fibonacci - inerative (using a for loop)

### Complicated example (objectFlat)
