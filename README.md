# next-level-recursion
Source code for the Dev.to article on recursion after factorials and Fibonacci

## Source Code

The following files demonstrate three different recursive functions, two simple and one more complicated. The simple examples are accompanied by there iterative counterparts.

### Simple (textbook) examples
* 1a: Factorial - iterative, using a for loop (factorial-i))
* 1b: Factorial - recursive (factorial-r)
* 2a: Fibonacci - iterative, using a for loop (fibonacci-i)
* 2b: Fibonacci - recursive (fibonacci-r)

### Complicated example
* 3a: objectFlat - initial (objectFlat_initial)
* 3b: objectFlat (objectFlat)

## Executing the examples
To execute the tests for a specific function use the following command in a terminal session.

`npm run <example>` where `<example>` is something like `1a` or `3b`.

### Pre-requisites
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
1. No need to execute `npm install` because there are no 3rd-party dependencies.
